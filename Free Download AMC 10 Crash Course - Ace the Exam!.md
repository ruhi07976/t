### Algebra Essentials

Algebra is a foundational component of the AMC 10. This section covers:

*   **Linear Equations and Inequalities:** Learn to solve and graph linear equations and inequalities, including those with absolute values. Master techniques for setting up and solving word problems involving linear relationships.
*   **Quadratic Equations:** Dive deep into quadratic equations, including factoring, completing the square, and using the quadratic formula. Understand the discriminant and its role in determining the nature of the roots.
*   **Polynomials:** Explore polynomial operations, factoring techniques (e.g., factoring by grouping, sum/difference of cubes), and the Remainder and Factor Theorems.
*   **Systems of Equations:** Solve systems of linear and nonlinear equations using various methods, such as substitution, elimination, and matrices.
*   **Functions:** Develop a strong understanding of functions, including domain, range, composition, and inverse functions. Learn to graph functions and analyze their properties.

### Geometry Mastery

Geometry is another critical area covered in the AMC 10. This section will equip you with the skills to:

*   **Triangles:** Master triangle properties, including angle relationships, side lengths, area formulas (e.g., Heron's formula), and similarity/congruence theorems.
*   **Circles:** Explore circle theorems related to angles, chords, tangents, and secants. Calculate arc lengths, sector areas, and segment areas.
*   **Polygons:** Learn about polygon properties, including interior/exterior angles, area formulas for regular polygons, and tessellations.
